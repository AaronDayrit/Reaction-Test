## Description
<p>
    The project involved developing a simple, modern web game aimed at calculating a person's reaction time using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This would have required creating a responsive and engaging user interface that incorporated the necessary game mechanics to accurately calculate reaction times.
</p>	

<p>
    To accomplish this, the project involved designing and implementing different functions and features using JavaScript to create a smooth and responsive gameplay experience. Additionally, the use of HTML and CSS would have been required to create the visual elements of the game, such as the game board, timer, and user interface.

<p>
	The game would have likely involved simple mechanics, such as having the player click on a moving object as quickly as possible. This would have required precise timing functionality to accurately calculate the player's reaction time.
